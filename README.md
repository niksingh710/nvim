## Configuration Structure

The configuration and plugins are structured in an organized manner, with Lua scripts stored in the `lua` directory. This modular approach ensures a clean and maintainable Neovim setup.

Feel free to explore and customize these scripts to tailor your Neovim environment to your preferences.
