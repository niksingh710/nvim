# My Neovim Config

Highly inspired by Lunarvim
But Eventually created my own as felt needed to learn lua and much more stuff....

## Leader

Whereever i mention leader it means "SPACE" key

I have very intutive mappings for my neovim
To get them all visible you can use `:Telescope keymaps` command
or Press `<leader>sk`

## Mappings

| Keymaps   | Description              |
| --------- | ------------------------ |
| jk        | To exit from insert mode |
| kj        | To exit from insert mode |
| <leader>q | To Quit                  |
| Ctrl s    | To Save                  |
| <leader>s | To go in search mode     |
| Ctrl j    | To move down             |
| Ctrl k    | To move up               |
| Ctrl h    | To move left             |
| Ctrl l    | To move right            |

These keymaps should get you going others you can just find

## Plugins

checkout [list.lua](./nvim/lua/niksingh710/list.lua) for the installed plugins.

## NOTE

I do use COPILOT for my neovim config as i have it's access being a open source dev.
if you don't have it you can disable it in the list.lua
