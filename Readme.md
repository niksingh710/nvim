# My keymaps are intutive and easy to remember

checkout them by `:Telescope keymaps` or by pressing `<leader> + sk`

## INSTALL

```
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
git clone https://github.com/niksingh710/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```

## Keymaps

can you write the keymaps from the old Readme file?

| Keymap          | Description          |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| jk              | To exit insert mode  |
| kj              | To exit insert mode  |
| `<c-s>`         | Save                 |
| `<leader> + q`  | Quit                 |
| `<leader> + e`  | Toggle the file tree |
| `<leader> + s`  | Search               |
| `<leader> + lf` | Format               |
| `<leader> + sk` | Keymap Search        |

This much should get you going and extra is all what you discover (fire.nvim) Ôá≤
